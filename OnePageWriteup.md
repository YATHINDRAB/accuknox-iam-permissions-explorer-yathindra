# One-Page Summary — IAM Permissions Explorer

## Problem
Cloud environments suffer from privilege creep and unused IAM permissions.  
Security engineers struggle to manually analyze roles, detect risk, and apply least-privilege recommendations.

## Solution
A simple IAM Permissions Explorer with:
1. **Overview Dashboard** — high-level IAM health  
2. **Risk Explorer** — filterable list of principals with risk scoring  
3. **Remediation Page** — recommended fixes + Terraform patches  

## Why these features
- Risk score + last-used detection → rapid prioritization  
- Filters + table view → fast investigation  
- Suggested patches → reduce remediation friction  
- Export reports → audit & compliance use  

## Prioritization
1. **Risk Scoring Engine** – highest user impact  
2. **Last-used Permission Analysis**  
3. **Risk Explorer Filters & Table**  
4. **Terraform Patch Suggestions** – value-add  

## Success Metrics
- 30% reduction in risky principals in 90 days  
- Time-to-remediate ↓ 50%  
- ≥60% weekly active usage  
- # of audit reports generated per month  

## Assumptions
- IAM and CloudTrail data accessible  
- AWS first; multi-cloud later  
- Users have access to IAM metadata
